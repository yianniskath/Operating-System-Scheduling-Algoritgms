# Operating-System-Scheduling-Algoritgms

These java files were for an Operating Systems exercise for my third year as a Computer Science studnet at the University of Glasgow.
We were asked to produce 3 process scheduling algorithms. These included:

First Come First Served
Search Job First
Round Robin

The input for these algorithms can be found in w1.csv and w2.csv which were generated from the Generator.java file
Each column of the csv file represents:

First Column: Process ID
Second Column: Time Taken for Process to be excecuted
Third Column: Arrival Time of Process

When each java file is compiled and run using java FCFS.java (for instance)
The terminal will print the Waiting time and Turnaround time for each proces along with it ID and the overall Waiting and Turnaround time.
